# Baobab API

Built using Flask and SQLAlchemy

## Prerequisites
### Running with Docker.

The development environment uses [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This makes it super easy to get up and running with a configuration that would closely mirror production. 

### Running locally
- TBC

## Installation

With Docker/Compose installed, use the following steps to launch for the first time:

* `docker-compose up` to start the web app. This will download and provision two containers: one running PostgreSQL and one running the Flask app. This will take a while, but once it completes subsequent launches will be much faster.
* When `docker-compose up` completes, the app should be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).


## Environment Variables


There are just a couple of configurations managed as environment variables. In the development environment, these are injected by Docker Compose and managed in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

* `DATABASE_URL` - This is the connection URL for the PostgreSQL database. It is not used in the **development environment**.
* `DEBUG` - This toggle debug mode for the app to True/False.
* `SECRET_KEY` - This is a secret string that you make up. It is used to encrypt and verify the authentication token on routes that require authentication.


## Project Organization


* Application-wide settings are stored in `config.py` at the root of the repository. These items are accessible on the `config` dictionary property of the `app` object. Example: `debug = app.config['DEBUG']`
* The directory `/app` contains the API application
* URL mapping is managed in `/app/routes.py`
* Functionality is organized in packages. Example: `/app/users` or `/app/utils`.
* Tests are contained in each package. Example: `app/users/tests.py`


## Running Tests


Tests are ran with [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) from inside the `docker-compose` web container:

```
$ docker-compose run web nosetests
```


## Database Migrations


Migrations for the provided models are part of the seed project. To generate new migrations use `Flask-Migrate`:

    $ docker-compose run web python ./api/run.py db migrate --directory api/migrations
    $ docker-compose run web python ./api/run.py db upgrade --directory api/migrations


## API Routes


This API uses token-based authentication. A token is obtained by registering a new user (`/api/v1/user`) or authenticating an existing user (`/api/v1/authenticate`). Once the client has the token, it must be included in the `Authorization` header of all requests.


### Register a new user

**POST:**
```
/api/v1/user
```

**Body:**
```json
{
    "email": "something@email.com",
    "password": "123456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImV4cCI6MTQxMDk2ODA5NCwiaWF0IjoxNDA5NzU4NDk0fQ.eyJpc19hZG1pbiI6ZmFsc2UsImlkIjoyLCJlbWFpbCI6InRlc3QyQHRlc3QuY29tIn0.goBHisCajafl4a93jfal0sD5pdjeYd5se_a9sEkHs"
}
```

**Status Codes:**
* `201` if successful
* `400` if incorrect data provided
* `409` if email is in use


### Get the authenticated user

**GET:**
```
/api/v1/user
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "email": "test2@test.com",
}
```

**Status Codes:**
* `200` if successful
* `401` if not authenticated


### Authenticate a user

**POST:**
```
/api/v1/authenticate
```

**Body:**
```json
{
    "email": "something@email.com",
    "password": "123456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImV4cCI6MTQxMDk2ODA5NCwiaWF0IjoxNDA5NzU4NDk0fQ.eyJpc19hZG1pbiI6ZmFsc2UsImlkIjoyLCJlbWFpbCI6InRlc3QyQHRlc3QuY29tIn0.goBHisCajafl4a93jfal0sD5pdjeYd5se_a9sEkHs"
}
```

**Status Codes:**
* `200` if successful
* `401` if invalid credentials
